# Climbing Kings Bluff Client: A way to log climbs at a local location

This application allows a user to store climbs. As a climber it is always fun to be able to look back on what you have done, and look at what you want to attempt.

**Planning Story**

I looked at the requirements for the app then laid out a plan to tackle each feature. I also needed to connect this project to another API project I had built, so using CRUD I could access the necessary API routes to achieve the app requirements. 
-Requirements-
Signup with email, password, and password confirmation.
Login with email and password.
Logout when logged in.
Change password with current and new password.
Signup and Signin must only be available to not signed in users.
Logout and Change password must only be available to signed in users.
Give feedback to the user after each action's success or failure.
All forms must clear after submit success and user sign-out

**User Stories**
- as a user I want to sign-up in the app so I can see all the climbs in the area other people have done

- as a user I want to sign-in to the app so I can log all my sweet sends

- as a user I want to log the climbs I have done

- as a user I want to see the climbs avaiable at Kings Bluff

- as a user I want to leave a reveiw of the climb so other users can see what I thought about it

- as a user I want to be able to update my reveiw incase I change my mind about a climb


**Technologies Used**
